# GoodDog

Good Dog was created to store different coding methods that can connect to external equipment and control it. These codes are viable in different pet situations and environments.

Treat - Treat is coding in python that responds to the voice command "Treat" that connects to an external dispenser that will then dispense a treat.

Stay - Stay is scripted to respond to movement using a PIR sensor. Theres a lot that can be altered and will need to be altered, but essentially it will repeat a chosen voice command telling the animal to stay whenever it moves. Part of a training regimine.
